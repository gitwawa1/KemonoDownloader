## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in KemonoDownloader, we encourage responsible disclosure to protect our users. We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping the project safe.

### How to Report
- **Preferred Method**: Email the maintainers at [izeno.contact@gmail.com](mailto:izeno.contact@gmail.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Please include:
  - A clear explanation of the issue (e.g., potential data leak, injection vulnerability).
  - Steps to reproduce the issue, if known.
  - The potential impact (e.g., unauthorized access, data exposure).
  - Any suggested mitigations, if applicable.
- **Alternative**: Use the [Security Report issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_report.yml) on our [Issues page](https://github.com/VoxDroid/KemonoDownloader/issues). However, we strongly recommend private reporting via email to avoid public disclosure before a fix is available.
- **Sensitive Matters**: For highly sensitive issues, you may open a private issue labeled "Security Violation" on the [Issues page](https://github.com/VoxDroid/KemonoDownloader/issues), visible only to maintainers.

### What to Expect
- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the issue within 7 days, prioritizing critical vulnerabilities.
- **Resolution**: If confirmed, we will develop and release a fix as soon as possible, typically within 14 days for critical issues. We will keep you updated on progress.
- **Disclosure**: We will coordinate with you on public disclosure after a fix is deployed, if necessary.
- **Credit**: With your permission, we will credit you in release notes or a security advisory for your responsible disclosure.

### Guidelines
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Do not publicly share details of the vulnerability until we have addressed it.
- **No Exploitation**: Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities in ways that harm users, creators, or the project (e.g., unauthorized data access or disruption).
- **Ethical Use**: Respect the intellectual property rights of creators and adhere to the terms of service of Kemono.su and related platforms (e.g., Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox), as outlined in our [README](README.md).
- **Follow Community Standards**: Adhere to our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Do not include unverified links or promotional content in reports, as they will be considered spam and may lead to restrictions.

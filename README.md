Welcome to **Kemono Downloader**, a versatile Python-based desktop application built with PyQt6, designed to download content from [Kemono.su](https://kemono.su). This tool enables users to archive individual posts or entire creator profiles from services like Patreon, Fanbox, and more, supporting a wide range of file types with customizable settings and advanced features.

## Important Notices

### Disclaimer

KemonoDownloader is a tool designed for personal and educational use only, to assist users in downloading content from Kemono.su. The maintainers of this project **do not condone or support the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material**. Users are solely responsible for ensuring they have the legal right to access and download content from Kemono.su, and for complying with all applicable laws, as well as the terms of service of the original platforms from which the content originates (e.g., Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox, Gumroad). 

**Misuse of this tool to infringe on creators’ rights, violate copyright laws, or breach terms of service is strictly prohibited.** The maintainers are not liable for any misuse of KemonoDownloader or any consequences arising from its use, including but not limited to legal action, financial loss, or damage to third parties.

### Ethical Use Guidelines

KemonoDownloader interacts with content from Kemono.su, which may include material originally posted on paywalled platforms like Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox, and Gumroad. Many creators on these platforms rely on paid subscriptions for their livelihood. Downloading and redistributing their content without permission can harm their ability to continue creating.

We strongly encourage users to:
- Use KemonoDownloader responsibly and only for content you have the legal right to access.
- Support creators directly by subscribing to their official channels on platforms like Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox, or Gumroad.
- Avoid redistributing downloaded content, as this may violate copyright laws and harm creators.

### Risks and Limitations

- **Dependency on Kemono.su**: KemonoDownloader relies on Kemono.su, which has a history of inconsistent updates and downtime. If Kemono.su becomes unavailable, this tool will lose its functionality.
- **Rate Limits and Errors**: Kemono.su may impose rate limits or other restrictions that affect download performance. The maintainers cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to Kemono.su’s content.

## Community Standards

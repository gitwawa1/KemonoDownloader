# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as contributors and maintainers of the KemonoDownloader project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment where all participants can collaborate constructively to improve KemonoDownloader, a tool for downloading content from Kemono.su.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as physical or email addresses, without their explicit permission ("doxing").
- Engaging in or promoting illegal activities, including the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material.
- Using KemonoDownloader to download or distribute content in violation of copyright laws or the terms of service of platforms like Patreon, Pixiv Fanbox, or Gumroad.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

Given that KemonoDownloader interacts with content from Kemono.su, we expect all participants to respect the intellectual property rights of creators and adhere to ethical standards when using the tool. Misuse of the tool to harm creators or violate their rights will not be tolerated.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any associated communication channels (e.g., email, Discord, or other platforms where the project is represented). It also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces, such as using an official project email address or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainers at [voxdroid.kemono@gmail.com](mailto:voxdroid.kemono@gmail.com). Alternatively, you can open a private issue in the repository labeled "Code of Conduct Violation," which will be visible only to maintainers.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. The maintainers will determine the appropriate response, which may include:

- **Warning**: A private, written warning to the individual, explaining the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate.
- **Temporary Ban**: A temporary suspension from participating in the project’s spaces (e.g., GitHub repository, discussions) for a specified period, with no interaction allowed during this time.
- **Permanent Ban**: A permanent expulsion from the project’s spaces for severe or repeated violations.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce this Code of Conduct in good faith may face repercussions as determined by other maintainers or the project’s leadership.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The maintainers will consider the following community impact guidelines when determining the consequences of a violation:

- **Minor Violation**: Use of inappropriate language or behavior deemed unprofessional.  
  **Consequence**: A private warning, with an opportunity to correct the behavior.
- **Moderate Violation**: A single incident or series of actions that violate community standards.  
  **Consequence**: A warning with a temporary ban if the behavior continues.
- **Severe Violation**: Sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment, or actions that harm the community (e.g., promoting illegal use of the tool).  
  **Consequence**: A permanent ban from the project.

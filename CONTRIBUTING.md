## Community Guidelines
To maintain a safe and productive environment, please adhere to the following rules:

Violations of these guidelines may result in warnings, removal of comments, temporary or permanent bans from contributing, or reporting to GitHub for further action. If you notice violations, report them to [izeno.contact@gmail.com](mailto:izeno.contact@gmail.com) or open a private issue labeled "Code of Conduct Violation."

### Fork and Clone the Repository
1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the [KemonoDownloader GitHub page](https://github.com/VoxDroid/KemonoDownloader).
2. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/KemonoDownloader.git
   cd KemonoDownloader
   ```

### Development Environment
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Install [Briefcase](https://briefcase.readthedocs.io/) for building the app:
   ```bash
   pip install briefcase
   ```
4. Test the app locally to ensure it runs:
   ```bash
   briefcase run
   ```

### Making Changes
- Write clean, readable code following Python best practices (e.g., [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)).
- If adding a new feature, ensure it aligns with the project’s goals (e.g., enhancing download functionality, improving the UI, or adding support for new file types).
- If fixing a bug, include a clear description of the issue and how your changes address it.
- Update documentation (e.g., `README.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, in-app Help tab) if your changes affect usage or installation.

### Testing
- Test your changes thoroughly on your local machine across supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) if possible, using Briefcase commands (e.g., `briefcase run windows`).
- Ensure the app works as expected (e.g., downloading posts, archiving creators, UI functionality).
- Verify that your changes don’t break existing features or introduce new bugs.

### Push and Submit a Pull Request
1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-new-feature
   ```
2. Go to the [KemonoDownloader GitHub page](https://github.com/VoxDroid/KemonoDownloader) and click "New Pull Request."
3. Select your branch and submit the pull request using the [Pull Request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). Include:

   - Links to any issues addressed (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
   - Screenshots or logs, if applicable (e.g., for UI changes).
4. Respond to feedback from maintainers, making updates to your branch as needed.

## Coding Standards
- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style (e.g., 4-space indentation, 79-character line length).
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `download_post` instead of `dp`).
- Add comments for complex logic to improve readability.
- Ensure compatibility with Python 3.9+ and PyQt6.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use constants or configuration files where appropriate.
